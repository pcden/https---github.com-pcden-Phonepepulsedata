Project Title: Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration: A User-Friendly Tool Using Streamlit and Plotly

Obejective: A comprehensive and user-friendly solution for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository. To create a live geo visualization dashboard that displays information and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository in an interactive and visually appealing manner.

Approach:

Data extraction: Cloned the Github using scripting to fetch the data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository and stored it in a suitable format such as CSV.

Data transformation: Used a scripting language Python, along with libraries such as Pandas, to manipulate and pre-process the data. This includes cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming the data into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

Database insertion: Used the "mysql-connector-python" library in Python to connect to MySQL database and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.

Dashboard creation: Used the Streamlit and Plotly libraries in Python to create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard. Plotly's built-in geo map functions were used to display the data on a map and Streamlit has been used to create a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display.

Data retrieval: Used the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Used the data in the dataframe to update the dashboard dynamically.

Deployment: Ensured that the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.
